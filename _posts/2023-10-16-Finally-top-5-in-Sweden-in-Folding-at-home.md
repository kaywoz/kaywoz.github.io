# Intro

I've had this setup running for almost a year now, chugging away to move forward on the Sweclockers-foldingteam, demolishing contributors as I go. This was originally a move to solve that I had become fed up with my sporadic usage of Google Colaboratory (until service was changed and stopped any such prolonged GPU usage, and my testing of vast.ai (works but nah) and runpod.io (more of the same so nah)) 

I finally landed on that I needed a dedi server somewhere, and Hostkey fit the bill with their RTX 4090 offering..

# What now?

Well, a couple of weeks until the I've claimed the 4th spot unless something happens.

It will take some time to reach the number 1 slot. And then....? What am I supposed to do after being the number 1 folder in Sweden? Stay there? Re-use the hardware for folding, and other stuff? Downgrade? Move on? I'll see when I get there.

Needless to say I need to document the build in the near future and I'll try to make it into a post by itself. Until then, cheers!
