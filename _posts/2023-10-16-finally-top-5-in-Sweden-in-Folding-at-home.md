# Intro

I've had this setup running for almost a year now, chugging away to move forward on the Sweclockers-foldingteam, demolishing contributors as I go. This was originally a move to solve that I had become fed up with my sporadic usage of [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/) (until the service was changed and any prolonged GPU usage was denied. My testing of [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai) (works but nah) and [runpod.io](https://runpod.io) (more of the same so nah) were stopped after some trial runs) 

I finally landed on that I needed a dedi server somewhere, and Hostkey fit the bill with their RTX 4090 offering..

# What now?

Well, it appears that I have a couple of more weeks until I've claimed the 4th spot unless something happens like a hardware or DC-failure or an apocalypse.

It will take some time to reach the number 1 slot. But what then....? What am I supposed to do after getting to the number 1 folder-slot in Sweden? Stay there? Re-use the hardware for folding, and other stuff? Downgrade? Move on? I'll see when I get there.

Needless to say I need to document the build in the near future and I'll try to make it into a post by itself.

Until then, cheers!
