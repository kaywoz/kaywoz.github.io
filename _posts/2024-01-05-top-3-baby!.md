# Intro

Well, it took some time and effort and money but my grunty machine has been spinning non-stop for a better cause for the last couple of months. It's finally made it through the last ditch effort and is now top 3 in Sweden. Thank the gods for simple cron monitoring to discord so that I get some kind of notion when the hardware acts up.

# What now?

So, 4+ months for spot 2 and then barely 6 months for the top spot. I still have not decided how to proceed afterwards, some more procrastination to be done I guess.

By the next update, I guess I'm ruling this roost with my dedi-monster machine, cya, peace!
