# Intro

Moved over from my dedicated Hostkey 5950x+RTX4090 setup to a more modest vm with passthrough GPU, still an RTX4090. Setup was fairly easy and sweet, even setup my healthchecks.io scripts to monitor the GPU-worker output and it has been stable so far. Still, the 40M PPD makes you go all jolly inside. 

# What now?

So, #2 spot is ~3 weeks away and then the lucrative #1 is a mere ~1.5 months away. Am starting to look into some sort of orchestration for dual tasking the GPU with 80% GPU time for FaH and 20% for some hashcat play for hashmob.net. We will see.

Aight peace!
