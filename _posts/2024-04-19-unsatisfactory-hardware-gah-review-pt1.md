# Intro

Aight, so I finally found somewhat of a solution to a problem I've had for some time. The ever elusive "how to solve the server in the closet connectivity and access if all breaks"-problem. Now, granted, I've not really had that much of a problem like this since more or less all of the service i build in homeops are for myself, not even the gf consumes them. My problem is easier than that, if I break something (something which happens more often than I'd like to admin) I get reeaaaalllly frustrated pulling hdmi-cables from tv-sets to have display for the server and dig out the usb octopus cable connectors for keyboard, usb memory stick, mouse in that order. Cant do it anymore, just so much frustration to deal with. 

So, I've been looking towards the [piKVM](https://pikvm.org/buy/) product and it's similar siblings, but it's simply to expensive, and yes I like tinkering. But no I dont want to tinker with this and buy hats and accessories and install software etc. I just want it to work, that is ok sometimes too!

So I found the [Aurga Viewer](https://www.aurga.com/), an hdmi hotspot device for cheap(er)...

# The product

Well, to start with it's small, ![aurga viewer](/assets/images/2024-04-19-unsatisfactory-hardware-gah-review-pt1/1.jpg) but that's to be expected as it only needs the hdmi-port and usb for power.
